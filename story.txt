Max is a special cat. He grows up in a tiny village with his sibilings. Unlike his brothers and sisters whose favourite food is fish, Max likes vegetables the most. He feels lonely and is eager to find someone who is similar to him. One day, while he was walking along the river, he met a tiger who was crying loudly. The tiger told Max that her name is Ann, and she was abondoned by her family since she could only eat grass.
