Max is a special cat. He grows up in a tiny village with his sibilings. Unlike his brothers and sisters whose favourite food is fish, Max likes vegetables the most. He feels lonely and is eager to find someone who is similar to him. One day, while he was walking along the river, he met a tiger who was crying loudly. The tiger told Max that her name is Ann, and she was abondoned by her family since she could only eat grass.

Max told the tiger that grass is like a vegetable, and that vegetables were his favorite food. Max told the tigers of all the times his brothers and sisters made fun of him for wanting vegetables over fish. This made ann feel a little bit better. The pair started talking for hours, and soon they made a decision. They decided to run away together, so they headed south.

Max and the tiger were fearless. They have never done anything like this before, yet they have never felt so alive. Max and the tiger were strolling through the woods, when they suddenly heard a scream. They looked at each other, confused and worried. So they started to investigate the scream.
